      "<p>Roscoe Mitchell and Camae Ayewa, who performs as Moor Mother, are among the most innovative performers and improvisors of their respective generations. Mitchell, a composer and multi-instrumentalist, co-founded the world renowned Art Ensemble of Chicago and helped to establish the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians (AACM). Moor Mother is a politically charged musician, poet, sound artist, and community activist. She works across disciplines as a member of the Black Quantum Futurism Collective. For this performance in the Art Institute's Fullerton Hall, Moor Mother and Roscoe Mitchell perform together as a duo.&nbsp;</p><p>This concert is presented partly in response to Simone Leigh's <em>Dunham</em> (2017). Leigh’s practice incorporates sculpture, video, and installation; all are informed by her ongoing exploration of black female subjectivity and ethnography. Her objects often employ materials and forms traditionally associated with African art; her performance-influenced installations create spaces where historical precedent and self-determination comingle. Through her investigations of visual overlaps between cultures, time periods, and geographies, she confronts and examines ideas of the female body, race, beauty, and community. </p><p>With her sculpture <em>Dunham</em> (2017), Leigh engages with the legacy of dancer and choreographer Katherin Dunham, credited for helping introduce African and Caribbean movement styles into the modernist dance vocabulary. For several decades, Dunham was based in East St. Louis, Illinois, where the artist, activist, and educator established the Performing Arts Training Center in 1967. Dunham’s legacy and influence lives on today.</p><p>The performance is presented as part of Artists Connect, a series of programs at the Art Institute that highlight the creative process. Artists, poets, dancers, and musicians engage with works of art, making connections to their own practice and inspiring new ways of understanding the Art Institute’s collection.</p><p>Presented with the Empty Bottle</p><p>Persons with disabilities who would like to request an accessibility accommodation for an Art Institute program are encouraged to send an email to <a href=\"mailto:access@artic.edu\">access@artic.edu</a> two weeks in advance of the program.&nbsp;</p>",

In 2016, he was a beneficiary of the first FreshGrass Composition Commission to preserve and support innovative grassroots music. He served as one of the original Resident Artistic Directors of San Francisco Jazz and is the subject of a new documentary film by Emma Franz entitled <em>Bill Frisell: A Portrait</em>, which examines his creative process in depth.</p><p>Persons with disabilities who would like to request an accessibility accommodation for an Art Institute program are encouraged to send an email to <a href=" access@artic.edu">access@artic.edu</a> two weeks in advance of the program.&nbsp;</p>',

Looking<br>ii. Name<br>iii. Um<br>iv. Very<br></p><p>I have long been fascinated by the musicality of speech sounds, and I have regularly incorporated them into my work, mining sampled fragments of spoken text for melodic, rhythmic, and textural content. To compose <em>Ways of Looking</em>, I began by interviewing all six members of Eighth Blackbird, and then I meticulously selected sentences, phrases, words, syllables, and phonemes to create sonic building blocks for the piece.<br></p><p>This work is in four movements, and each movement focuses on sounds or concepts culled from those interviews. For the first movement, “Looking,” I chose to have the ensemble speak their own words live. I pulled samples from their answers to a question about the origin of the ensemble’s name. They each answered that question by citing the Wallace Stevens poem that is their namesake. I built a text collage from fragments of that title and then transcribed it and integrated it into their parts.<br></p><p>The second movement, “Name,” is all about describing and identifying people. The tape part of this movement consists entirely of names and descriptions (often of teachers or mentors) mentioned in the interviews, and the instrumental parts are laced with melodic and rhythmic transcriptions of those phrases. Movement three, “Um,” is a cloud of sound built around the sonorous, nonverbal filler sounds we all make during speech. I find “um”s and “uh”s to be among the most musical spoken utterances because they are more sustained and contain more focused pitch than most of the words we speak.<br></p><p>The final movement, “Very” celebrates the ubiquitous intensifier. I found so many descriptors that were modified by “very” in the interview responses that I thought they deserved a dedicated movement. The melodic material in this movement was inspired by a section of a score I composed a few years ago, for a dance piece by choreographer Stephan Koplowitz, that kept haunting me as I listened to my long list of Eighth Blackbird “very”s. I also choose to include a part for my own voice and electronics in this movement.<br></p><p>I’ve long admired Eighth Blackbird, and listening to and editing their speaking voices was a heartwarming experience  that gave me a sense of knowing them better. I like to think of this work as a kind of sonic portrait that I hope does them justice in at least a small way.<br></p><p>—Pamela Z (2019)</p><p><strong>About Eighth Blackbird</strong><br><br>Eighth Blackbird, hailed by the <em>Chicago Tribune</em> as “one of the smartest, most dynamic contemporary classical ensembles on the planet,” began in 1996 as a group of six entrepreneurial Oberlin Conservatory students and quickly became, as the <em>Detroit Free Press </em>wrote, “a brand-name defined by adventure, vibrancy and quality." Over the course of more than two decades, Eighth Blackbird has continually pushed at the edges of what it means to be a contemporary chamber ensemble, presenting distinct programs in Chicago, nationally, and internationally, reaching audiences totaling tens of thousands. The sextet has commissioned and premiered hundreds of works by composers both established and emerging, and it has perpetuated the creation of music with profound impact, such as Steve Reich’s <em>Double Sextet</em>, which went on to win the 2009 Pulitzer Prize. The ensemble’s extensive recording history, primarily with Chicago’s Cedille Records, has produced more than a dozen acclaimed albums and four Grammy Awards for Best Small Ensemble/Chamber Music Performance, most recently in 2016 for <em>Filament</em>. Longstanding collaborative relationships have led to performances with some of the most well-regarded classical artists of today, from heralded performers like Dawn Upshaw and Jeremy Denk to seminal composers like Philip Glass and Nico Muhly. For recent projects, Eighth Blackbird has joined forces with artists who defy the persistent distinction between classical and nonclassical music, including composers Bryce Dessner of the National and Arcade Fire’s Richard Reed Perry as well as performers Justin Vernon of Bon Iver, My Brightest Diamond frontwoman Shara Nova, Will Oldham (aka Bonnie “Prince” Billy), and Iarla Ó Lionáird of the Gloaming, among others.</p><p>Eighth Blackbird first gained wide recognition in 1998 as winners of the Concert Artists Guild Competition. Since 2000, the ensemble has called Chicago home and has been committed to serving as both importer and exporter of world-class artistic experiences. A recent yearlong pioneering residency at the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago, during which the ensemble served as a living installation with open rehearsals, performances, guest artists, and public talks, exemplified their status as community influencers. Receiving the prestigious MacArthur Award for Creative and Effective Institutions, Chamber Music America’s inaugural Visionary Award, and being named Musical America’s 2017 Ensemble of the Year have supported Eighth Blackbird’s position as a catalyst for innovation in the new music ecosystem of Chicago and beyond.</p><p>Eighth Blackbird’s mission—moving music forward through innovative performance, advocating for new music by living composers, and creating a legacy of guiding an emerging generation of musicians—extends beyond recording and touring to curation and education. The ensemble served as Music Director of the 2009 Ojai Music Festival, has held residencies at the Curtis Institute of Music and the University of Chicago, and holds an ongoing Ensemble-in-Residence position at the University of Richmond. In 2017, Eighth Blackbird launched its boldest initiative yet with the creation of Blackbird Creative Laboratory, an inclusive, two-week summer workshop and performance festival for performers and composers in Ojai, California.</p><p>The members of Eighth Blackbird hail from the Great Lakes, Keystone, Golden, Empire, and Bay states. The name “Eighth Blackbird” derives from the eighth stanza of Wallace Stevens’s evocative, imagistic poem, <em>Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird: </em>“I know noble accents / And lucid, inescapable rhythms; / But I know, too, / That the blackbird is involved / In what I know.”</p><p><strong>About Pamela Z</strong></p><p>Pamela Z is a composer/performer and media artist who works primarily with voice, live electronic processing, sampled sound, and video. A pioneer of live digital looping techniques, she processes her voice in real time to create dense, complex sonic layers. Her solo works combine experimental extended vocal techniques, operatic bel canto, found objects, text, digital processing, and wireless MIDI controllers that allow her to manipulate sound with physical gestures. In addition to her solo work, she has been commissioned to compose scores for dance, theater, film, and chamber ensembles including Kronos Quartet, the Bang on a Can All Stars, Ethel, and San Francisco Contemporary Music Players. Her interdisciplinary performance works have been presented at venues including The Kitchen, New York; Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, San Francisco; REDCAT, Los Angeles; and the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago. Her installations have been presented at such exhibition spaces as the Whitney, New York; the Diözesanmuseum, Cologne; and the Krannert, Illinois. Pamela Z has toured extensively throughout the US, Europe, and Japan. She has performed in numerous festivals including Bang on a Can at Lincoln Center, New York; Interlink, Japan; Other Minds, San Francisco; La Biennale di Venezia, Italy; Dak’Art, Sénégal; and Pina Bausch Tanztheater Festival, Wuppertal, Germany. She is the recipient of numerous awards including the Rome Prize, a Robert Rauschenberg Foundation residency, a Guggenheim Fellowship, the Doris Duke Artist Impact Award, Herb Alpert Award in the Arts, an Ars Electronica honorable mention, and the NEA Japan/US Friendship Commission Fellowship. She holds a music degree from the University of Colorado, Boulder.

His work, noted for its visual simplicity and sensitivity to its surroundings, is also characterized by an acute attention to materials: large expanses of unadorned concrete walls are combined with wooden or stone floors. In addition, his projects engage with natural elements, incorporating the sun, rain, and wind as distinctive features. Ando has designed many notable buildings, including Row House in Sumiyoshi, Osaka, 1976, which won the annual prize of the Architectural Institute of Japan in 1979; Church of the Light, Osaka, 1989; the Pulitzer Foundation for the Arts, St. Louis, 2001; Teatro Armani, Milan, 2001; Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth, 2002; and 21_21 Design Sight in Tokyo, 2007. His many awards include the Gold Medal of Architecture, Academie d\'Architecture (French Academy of Architecture) in 1989; the Pritzker Architecture Prize in 1995; Gold Medal of the American Institute of Architects in 2002; and Gold Medal of Union Internationale des Architectes in 2005. Ando is an honorary member of the American Institute of Architects and the American Academy of Arts and Letters as well as the Royal Academy of Arts in London. He has taught widely, including at the universities of Yale, Columbia, Harvard, and Berkeley.</p><p>Presented with the Architecture &amp; Design Society and the Alphawood Foundation Chicago</p><p>Presented by the Butler-VanderLinden Lecture on Architecture and the Alphawood Foundation Chicago</p>',

      '<p>In commemoration of her special exhibition <a href="/exhibition/judy-ledgerwood-chromatic-patterns-art-institute-chicago"><em>Judy Ledgerwood: Chromatic Patterns for the Art Institute of Chicago</em></a>, hear from Ledgerwood as she reflects upon her work as an artist. </p><p><strong >About the Artist</strong></p><p>Judy Ledgerwood (American, born 1959) is a Chicago-based painter whose canvases and wall painting installations confront the history of abstract painting. Her work simultaneously considers domestically created decorative work made by women across cultures. Compositions consist of motifs that are derived from symbolic shapes associated with Paleo and Neolithic Goddess cultures throughout Europe. The vocabulary of shapes featured in her work is comprised of circles, quatrefoils, and a seed-like shape organized within triangles and chevrons that she perceives as womanly ciphers symbolic of feminine power.</p><p>Judy Ledgerwood received a BFA from the Art Academy of Cincinnati and an MFA from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. She has held numerous solo exhibitions, most recently at the Graham Foundation and Smart Museum of Art, Chicago, IL; Tracy Williams Ltd, New York; Barbara Davis Gallery, Houston, TX; Hausler Contemporary, Austria; and Rhona Hoffman Gallery, among many others. She is the recipient of several awards including The Richard H. Driehaus Foundation Award, an Artadia Award, a Tiffany Award in the Visual Arts, a National Endowment for the Arts Award, and an Illinois Art Council Award. Judy Ledgerwood\'s work is included in prominent public collections including the Art Institute of Chicago; the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; the Museum of Contemporary Art Los Angeles; the Milwaukee Museum of Art; the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago; and the Kunstmuseum St. Gallen Switzerland, among others. In 2015, Ledgerwood was commissioned by the Embassy of the United States in Vientiane, Laos to create a monumental site-specific painting, and in 2018 she became the first Chicago-based artist to create an installation for the Art Institute\'s Bluhm Family Terrace. Judy Ledgerwood is the Alice Welsh Skilling Professor of Art at Northwestern University.</p><p>To request an accessibility accommodation for an Art Institute program, please call (312) 443-3680 or send an email to <a href="mailto:access@artic.edu">access@artic.edu</a> as far in advance as possible.</p><p>Please see the museum’s <a href="/accessibility" target="_blank">Accessibility page</a> for more information.</p>',

Over a period of nearly ten years, Homocore Chicago presented numerous artists, including Vaginal Davis, and helped to create an intersectional punk scene that continues today through the work of collectives such as Black, Brown, and Indigenous Crew.</p><p><strong><u>FEATURED BANDS</u></strong><br>Blacker Face<br>The Breathing Light<br>Mermaid N.V.<br>GoldGrrl</p><p><strong>About Black, Brown, and Indigenous Crew<br></strong>Black, Brown, and Indigenous Crew (BBIC) works to create spaces that center black, brown, and indigenous peoples (BIPOC); welcome BIPOC queer, trans, and gender-nonconforming folx; and dismantle oppressive structures through punk, hardcore, heavy metal, rap, hip-hop, indie, and alternative music. Current BBIC organizers worked on the Black and Brown Punk Show Festival: Or Does It Explode in 2017, and organized the Black, Brown, and Indigenous Crew Punk Fest: The Resurrection in 2018. BBIC honors all the work previous Black and Brown Punk Fest organizers did to pave the way for this work and are proud to continue to uphold DIY values.&nbsp;</p>',
